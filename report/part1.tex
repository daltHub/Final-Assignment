\subsubsection{Selection of Station}
In choosing the stations I was going to use I decided to display them on a map.
This would make it easier to choose stations which would have different behaviour.
I decided to choose station 97 (Kilmainham Gaol) as it is the furthest from the city center.
I also chose station 109 (Buckingham Street) as it is beside Connolly and I assumed it would have drastically different behaviour than my other station.

The data that I needed was the time and number of available bikes.
